		<title>The Passenger</title>

		<h2>The Passenger</h2>
			<p>I had been in a wave pool<br>
we were visiting<br>
barely large enough to fit <br>
the full-size man I’m not <br>
<br>
still I kicked against it <br>
knowing I’d be pushed back <br>
the memory of someone <br>
who has died no different <br>
<br>
in my mind and Wanda <br>
she’d be very old now too <br>
<br>
I had been learning <br>
my body and liked <br>
most of all to be alone <br>
with it new places <br>
<br>
my hair stiffed with <br>
chlorine when we left <br>
cold on the journey<br>
the wet road a gyroscope <br>
<br>
it happens when you <br>
briefly close your eyes</p>

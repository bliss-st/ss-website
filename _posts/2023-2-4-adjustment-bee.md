<em>No winter this year in New York.</em>
<br><br>

It is too late to falter in our walk into the eyes<br>
<br>
We ascend the stairs then cling to the rungs<br>
<br>
Satiate the bee in her warm home with a little soda<br>
<br>
Shoulder surface in the springlight annealing<br>
<br>
Razed, the rooms kissed last show no sign<br>
<br>
Holy we cross the rooftops no building ours<br>
<br>
Nor could be owned except by cleaving<br>
<br>
Except by hands alight on lumbar holy<br>
<br>
Soda fizzing black in the tiny fixtured eyes

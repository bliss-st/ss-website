> Through centuries he lived in poverty.  
> God only was his only elegance.  
>   
> Then generation by generation he grew  
> Stronger and freer, a little better off.  
>   
> He lived each life because, if it was bad,  
> He said a good life would be possible.  
>   
> At last the good life came, good sleep, bright fruit,  
> And Lazarus betrayed him to the rest,  
>   
> Who killed him, sticking feathers in his flesh  
> To mock him. They placed with him in his grave  
>   
> Sour wine to warn him, an empty book to read;  
> And over it they set a jagged sign,  
>   
> Epitaphium to his death, which read,  
> The Good Man Has No Shape, as if they knew.

I can’t make head or tails of this poem.

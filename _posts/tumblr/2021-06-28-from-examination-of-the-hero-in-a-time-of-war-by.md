II

The Got whome we serve is able to deliver  
Us. Good chemistry, good common man, what  
Of that angelic sword? Creature of&nbsp;  
Ten times ten times dynamite, convulsive  
Angel, convulsive shatterer, gun,  
Click, click, the Got whom we serve is able,  
Still, still to deliver us, still magic,  
Still moving yet motionless in smoke, still  
One with us, in the heaved-up noise, still&nbsp;  
Captain, the man of skill, the expert  
Leader, the creator of bursting color  
And rainbow sortilege, the savage weapon&nbsp;  
Against enemies, against the prester,  
Presto, whose whispers prickle the spirit.

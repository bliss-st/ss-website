I have come inside to tell you  
the world floats around us,  
insolent weeds and grape arbors,  
bottles and rust.  
Leave me alone to sing,  
I will bother no one.  
I remember a boy  
who danced with a fish.  
How can I answer  
his mutterings,  
that I should remember him  
diving there?  
He’ll dive forever  
unless I forego  
memory, song,  
my fool’s-truth lever  
under the solidly wrong.  
I remember a man  
who loved me forever,  
so briefly.  
I remember a woman  
who told him yes  
I will love you forever.  
She is still singing  
and he is gone.  
This is not his song.  
Soon it will happen.  
I am getting older  
and breathing thinner  
air at this altitude.  
Thinner and colder.

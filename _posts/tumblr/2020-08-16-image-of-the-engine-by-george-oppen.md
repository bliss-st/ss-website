Likely as not a ruined head gasket  
Spitting at every power stroke, if not a crank shaft  
Bearing knocking at the roots of the thing like a pile-driver:  
A machine involved with itself, a concentrated  
Hot lump of a machine  
Geared in the loose mechanics of the world with the valves jumping  
And the heavy frenzy of the pistons. When the thing stops,  
Is stopped, with the last slow cough&nbsp;  
In the manifold, the flywheel blundering  
Against compression, stopping, finally  
Stopped, compression leaking  
From the idle cylinders will one imagine  
Then because he can imagine  
That squeezed from the cooling steel  
There hovers in that moment, wraith-like and like a plume of steam, an aftermath,  
A still and quiet angel of knowledge and of comprehension.

Endlessly, endlessly  
The definition of mortality

The image of the engine  
That stops.  
We cannot live on that.  
I know that no one would live out  
Thirty years, fifty years if the world were ending  
With his life.  
The machine stares out,  
Stares out  
With all its eyes

Thru the glass  
With the ripple in it, past the sill  
Which is dusty—If there is someone  
In the garden!  
Outside, and so beautiful.

What ends  
Is that.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even companionship  
Ending.

‘I want to ask if you remember  
When we were happy! As tho all travels

Ended untold, all embarkations&nbsp;  
Foundered.

On that water  
Grey with morning  
The gull will fold its wings  
And sit. And with its two eyes  
There as much as anything  
Can watch a ship and all its hallways  
And all companions sink.

_Also he has set the world  
In their hearts_ . From lumps, chunks,

We are locked out: like children, seeking love  
At last among each other. With their first full strength  
The young go search for it,

But even the beautiful bony children  
Who arise in the morning have left behind  
Them worn and squalid toys in the trash

Which is a grimy death of love. The lost  
Glitter of the stores!  
The streets of stores!  
Crossed by the streets of stores  
And every crevice of the city leaking  
Rubble: concrete, conduit, pipe, a crumbling  
Rubble of our roots

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But they will find  
In flood, storm, ultimate mishap:  
Earth, water, the tremendous  
Surface, the heart thundering  
Absolute desire.

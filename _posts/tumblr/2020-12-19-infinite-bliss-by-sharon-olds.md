> I’ve read this poem each winter for the past 3 winters. At first I thought it was hot, then I thought it was frightening. In any case, it definitely doesn’t snow here in New York as much as it used to. Last year it got cold but there was just one day of snow. A dusting of less than an inch that melted before sundown. This year people are predicting blizzards again but with no real confidence.

Currently looking at 6 inches of snow in the backyard, so maybe&nbsp;“they” were onto something.

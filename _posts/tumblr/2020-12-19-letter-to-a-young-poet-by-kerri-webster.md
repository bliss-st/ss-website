Do whatever it takes to rest. When sorrow  
sits on your chest, give him a lick. I have no clue  
if I’m old or young. I think you’re a young lady  
who should know I’ve never been to a castle,  
though I did spend a day at the Climatron and,  
after, scooped lotus pods from the mud. They  
didn’t dry well. I wish you well. It’s possible  
for a year to forget where it left itself. Don’t  
worry. The trees immolate. My waking dreams  
involve shoeing horses, pounding silver sheet  
into a lake. “A match burning in a crocus”: I’d feed  
children to wolves to be so precise. <!-- more -->My house  
blinks all night with small lights. I know you know  
what I mean. I love incandescence the way  
some women love God. Where you are, is it  
gone? Do all the lights hum in sad tubes? I seam  
the hour to the hour, flee parties like a woman  
might flee killer bees. Go to sleep. Was a girlhood,  
some hitchhiking, a man like a Viking stirring  
polenta on an island in another century several  
cataclysms ago: blink of an eye. Take the State  
for a patron, but not for a wife. If sometimes  
I seem not here, it’s not dreaminess; it’s fear.   
If sometimes I don’t hear, it’s not celestial  
ringing, but this inner ear thing I’ve had since  
I lived in the city. At Babel, all the workers  
knew the Milky Way spread like fat between meat  
but felt zero need to say so. Look at something  
till your eyes burn. Pitcher plants drown  
their prey: not euphemism. The kettle’s burning.   
A woman felt called by don’t-know-what  
scratching like plumeria inside her. Abide, abide  
says alluvial time. Trickster, long con, light  
throws its nets over the yard. These words reek  
of eucalyptus, bathtub gin. When the sky  
turns absinthe, take cover. Say you’re watching  
the play where the woman turns into a tree and  
suddenly, first act: tornado sirens. Her soul is sap.  
Water pools on the floor. Ask yourself: do I love  
the woman I’m sitting with? Don’t get gyred into sky.  
It’s lonely there. Listen: the book is always burning.  
So’s the city. The water on stage is prop water,  
can’t put out anything. Blink if you can hear me.

back in the day of museums  
if you remember  
there was one north of the city  
where a room had been styled to resemble  
the simple quarters of the early Christians

on the wall of that room  
a painting of precisely that room  
but in that image, annunciation

tell me an angel  
isnâ€™t a trick of the eye

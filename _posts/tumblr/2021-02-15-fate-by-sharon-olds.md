Finally I just gave up and became my father,  
his greased, defeated face shining toward  
anyone I looked at, his mud-brown eyes  
in my face, glistening like wet ground that  
things you love have fallen onto  
and been lost for good. I stopped trying  
not to have his bad breath,  
his slumped posture of failure, his sad  
sex dangling on his thigh, his stomach  
swollen and empty. I gave in&nbsp;  
to my true self, I faced the world  
through his sour mash, his stained acrid  
vision, I floated out on his tears.  
I saw the whole world shining  
with the ecstasy of his grief, and I  
myself, he, I, shined,  
my oiled porous cheeks glaucous  
as tulips, the rich smear of the petal,  
the bulb hidden in the dark soil,  
stuck, impacted, sure of its rightful place.

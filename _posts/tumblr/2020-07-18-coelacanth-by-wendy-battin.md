Monster sleep,  
what runs in your trenches, your thought  
estuarial, briny or brackish but never fresh.  
The tides have passed a law  
for the conservation of salt, and since there’s salt  
in blood there’s salt in every wound.  
The little crystals bite. The thinking hurts.  
Dear monster I

feel for you, would it were otherwise. Here where  
river and ocean contend&nbsp;  
that river be river and ocean, ocean,  
both are mistaken.  
Where flow makes churn  
and long waves ravel  
and the stray coelacanth pops up, says _Uncle_  
or _Pass Not_&nbsp;or _Wake Now for monster_

_must be alone_, I wake, obedient  
weary. I dreamed you  
had something to tell me.

the feelings I get  
driving past the railroad yard  
(never on purpose but on my way to somewhere)  
are the feelings other men have for other things.  
I see the tracks and all the boxcars  
the tank cars the flat cars  
all of them motionless and so many of them  
perfectly lined up and not an engine anywhere  
(where are all the engines?).  
I drive past looking sideways at it all  
a wide, still railroad yard  
not a human in sight  
then I am past the yard  
and it wasn’t just the romance of it all  
that gives me what I get  
but something back there nameless  
always making me feel better  
as some men feel better looking at the open sea  
or the mountains or at wild animals  
or at a woman  
I like those things too  
especially the wild animals and the woman  
but when I see those lovely old boxcars  
with their faded painted lettering  
and those flat cars and those fat round tankers  
all lined up and waiting  
I get quiet inside  
I get what other men get from other things  
I just feel better and it’s good to feel better  
whenever you can  
not needing a reason.

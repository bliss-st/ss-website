I'm looking for submissions for a couple things.

1. Writing on pain for <a href="https://thequarterlessreview.com/Torment-1"><em>Torment</em></a>.
2. Poems that use any word or phrase from <a href="https://serenasol.in/2021/08/from-will-alexanders-across-the-vapour-gulf">this poem</a> by Will Alexander. 

If you have writing like this and want to see it out in the world, shoot me an email at ss3789990@gmail.com. I promise I'll take good care of it.

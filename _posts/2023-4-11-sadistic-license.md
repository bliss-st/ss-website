<em>[The Sadistic License of Privacy]</em>

Though I knew it could not exist I craved a canonical version, some XML to dig my teeth into, automated instances unfailingly rendered with every error grandfathered in. Though I knew it could not exist I defined attributions plastic enough to accept varieties of inputs withoutputting garbage back into the world. Though I knew it could not exist I mediated the limitless with structures capacious enough to hold it, backrooms, iced blacktops, and so on, parent classes, child classes, spent and loaded placeguns. Though I knew it could not exist I made a book of all things and then, of course, overwrote it. Though I knew it could not exist the inevitability of some contrasting with the coincidence of others became a value judgment, but not to me. For I knew I could not hope to understand this never mind explain it, all I can do is reproduce it perfectly.

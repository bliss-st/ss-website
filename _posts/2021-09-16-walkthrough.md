As I am unable to imagine<br>
That the dragon has shadow<br>
Powers, or double damage<br>
Powers, I am prohibited<br>
From the subtle striking of the<br>
Left and right buttons<br>
Which at particular moments<br>
Seems as much a skill as<br>
The ratchet or the good knife<br>
Require, and because I cannot<br>
See myself as prince of any land<br>
I become the voice of the guide.<br>
The only path through fire,<br>
Hedges, the undersea level<br>
Becomes apparent through me.<br>
What was play becomes<br>
More similar to a march<br>
Over acrid tundra, ending<br>
(Make no mistake, ending)<br>
The way we knew it would<br>
Having seen the end screen<br>
Long ago, in childhood.<br>
If I seem reluctant to heft<br>
The sword, even the book<br>
Of spells, it is because I know<br>
The answers, honestly or not.<br>
I can’t let you go into the cave<br>
Without a way out.

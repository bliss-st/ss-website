As I am unable to imagine<br>
that the dragon has shadow<br>
powers, or double damage<br>
powers, I am prohibited<br>
from the subtle striking of the<br>
left and right buttons<br>
which at particular moments<br>
seems as much a skill as<br>
the ratchet or the good knife<br>
require, and because I cannot<br>
see myself as prince of any land<br>
I become the voice of the guide.<br>
The only path through fire,<br>
hedges, the undersea level<br>
becomes apparent through me.<br>
What was play becomes<br>
more similar to a march<br>
over acrid tundra, ending<br>
(make no mistake, ending)<br>
the way we knew it would<br>
having seen the end screen<br>
long ago, in childhood.<br>
If I seem reluctant to heft<br>
the sword, even the book<br>
of spells, it is because I know<br>
the answers, honestly or not.<br>
I can’t let you go into the cave<br>
without a way out.<br>

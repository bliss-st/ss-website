A bit of a difficult spring... but reading a lot. I like interacting with people on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46654096-serena">Goodreads</a> so if you're on there, add me.

Besides that, Beautiful Open Prairie and Annotations #2 are slowly making their way to print. Sorry if I owe you an email.

A correction note to a mysterious entity:<br>
it is not just the days, but the presences <br>
which are growing longer. To absorb and<br>
transmit a single wavelength, focusing<br>
fatal energy inward, down three stories<br>
to the tenants, is my sole career, my life’s<br>
only occupation. Solitary on the roof,<br>
the brick chimney dissembling, I speak<br>
a language understood by dogs, cats,<br>
birds, and the irrational. As the sun<br>
stays later and later, I come to fear<br>
all animated things, the imminent,<br>
the inevitable, terribly: the unbridled<br>
loosed upon the world, the escape<br>
of the spirits I’ve gathered into me.<br>
For there is a fault in my manufacturing.<br>
There is a bulb which does not flicker<br>
because it was born dead, neither green<br>
nor intervallic. No human can know<br>
if I am powered on without listening.<br>
I become the intolerable answer<br>
to his circuitry before leading us away,<br>
along the blind path, where eventually<br>
man, mineral, and electricity are one,<br>
the loop closed by my master’s fleshy<br>
hand, the hideous moment of joining—

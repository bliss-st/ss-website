<em>Emily Dickinson, from Susan Howe</em>

A bit of a difficult spring here in Maspeth... but reading a lot. I'm trying to figure out what "creative scholarship" means, so a lot of Susan Howe. I like interacting with people on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46654096-serena">Goodreads</a> so if you're on there, add me.

Besides that, <em>Beautiful Open Prairie</em> and <em>Annotations #2</em> are slowly making their way to print. Sorry if I owe you an email with regards to either of these.

Here's a poem I'm still working on, probably the one I'll include in this issue of <em>Annotations</em>:
<blockquote>
<b>Solar Inverter</b><br>
<br>
A correction note to a mysterious entity:<br>
it is not just the days, but the presences<br>
which are growing longer. Bound by wire<br>
to the roof, the brick chimney dissembling,<br>
I speak a language understood by cats,<br>
birds, and the irrational. I begin to fear<br>
like all animated things, the imminent,<br>
the inevitable, terribly: the unbridled<br>
loosed upon the world, the escape<br>
of the spirits I’ve gathered into me.<br>
For there is a fault in my manufacturing.<br>
There is a bulb which does not flicker<br>
because it was born dead, neither green<br>
nor intervallic. No human can know<br>
if I am powered on without listening<br>
for my slight hum, low in the polyphony.<br>
To his circuitry I become the intolerable<br>
answer, the blind path, where eventually<br>
man, mineral, and electricity are one,<br>
the loop closed by my master’s fleshy<br>
hand, the hideous moment of joining—

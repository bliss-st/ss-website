A bit of a difficult spring... but reading a lot. I like interacting with people on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46654096-serena">Goodreads</a> so if you're on there, add me.

Besides that, Beautiful Open Prairie and Annotations #2 are slowly making their way to print. Sorry if I owe you an email.

Here's a poem I'm still working through:

#### Solar Inverter

A correction note to a mysterious entity:
it is not just the days, but the presences 
which are growing longer. To absorb and
transmit a single wavelength, focusing
fatal energy inward, down three stories
to the tenants, is my sole career, my life’s
only occupation. Solitary on the roof,
the brick chimney dissembling, I speak
a language understood by dogs, cats,
birds, and the irrational. As the sun
stays later and later, I come to fear
all animated things, the imminent,
the inevitable, terribly: the unbridled
loosed upon the world, the escape
of the spirits I’ve gathered into me.
For there is a fault in my manufacturing.
There is a bulb which does not flicker
because it was born dead, neither green
nor intervallic. No human can know
if I am powered on without listening.
I become the intolerable answer
to his circuitry before leading us away,
along the blind path, where eventually
man, mineral, and electricity are one,
the loop closed by my master’s fleshy
hand, the hideous moment of joining—

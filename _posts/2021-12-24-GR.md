<p>It took me six months to read this book, the longest any book has taken me to date. Here are some of my clippings.</p>

<blockquote>Ruin is formal, devil's work, Consecutive and low—Fail in an instant no man did, Slipping is crash's law, still they would keep on.</blockquote>

Images of moiré, wire, schematics, etc: 

<blockquote>Halfway between the water and the coarse sea-grass, a long stretch of pipe and barbed wire rings in the wind. The black latticework is propped up by longer slanting braces, lances pointing out to sea. An abandoned and mathematical look: stripped to the force-vectors holding it where it is, doubled up in places one row behind another, moving as Pointsman and Mexico begin to move again, backward in thick moiré, repeated uprights in parallax against repeated diagonals, and the snarls of wire below interfering more at random.</blockquote>

This early description of Katje:

<blockquote>The cameraman is pleased at the unexpected effect of so much flowing crepe, particularly when Katje passes before a window and the rainlight coming through changes it for a few brief unshutterings to murky glass, charcoal-saturated, antique and weather-worn, frock, face, hair, hands, slender calves all gone to glass and glazing, for the celluloid instant poised—the translucent guardian of a rainfall shaken through all day by rocket blasts near and far, downward, dark and ruinous behind her the ground which, for the frames' passage, defines her.</blockquote>

Also this one:

<blockquote>She has turned her face, more than once, to the Outer Radiance and simply seen nothing there. And so each time has taken a little more of the Zero into herself.</blockquote>

Some one-liners:

<blockquote>Proverbs for Paranoids 4: You hide, <em>They</em> seek.</blockquote>

<blockquote>AN ARMY OF LOVERS CAN BE BEATEN.</blockquote>

Will add to these as I go back through...

For intelligent commentary on the color white (see <em>Moby Dick</em>) and "the dullest hallucinations known to psychopharmacology," I can't recommend <a href="https://shoutengine.com/DeathIsJustAroundtheCorner/">Michael S. Judge's podcast</a> enough... thanks D for the recommendation. 

Finally:

<blockquote>But Felipe's particular rock embodies also an intellectual system, for he believes [...] in a form of mineral consciousness not too much different from that of plants and animals, except for the time scale. Rock's time scale is a lot more stretched out. "We're talking frames per century," Felipe like everybody else here lately has been using a bit of movie language, "per millennium!" Colossal. But Felipe has come to see [...] that history as it's been laid on the world is only a fraction, an outward-and-visible fraction. That we must also look to the untold, to the silence around us, to the passage of the next rock we notice—to its aeons of history under the long and female persistence of water and air (who'll be there, once or twice per century, to trip the shutter?) down to the lowland where your paths, human and mineral, are most likely to cross...</blockquote>

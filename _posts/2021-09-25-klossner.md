I'm proud to have worked on <a href="https://thequarterlessreview.com/leonard-klossner">this piece</a> with writer Leonard Klossner and editor David Kuhnlein for <em>The Quarterless Review</em>. It's not easy to convince folks to run a book review of a book with this much graphic violence. 
<blockquote>With all of this said, we may finally ask: What does <em>Cicatrization</em> steal? What does it take? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Instead, the text is intensely, obsessively, and violently productive. Because a wound (upon the flesh or upon the psyche) produces a radical change upon and beneath the site of its surface. Because to murder is to produce a corpse. The gouge, the slit, the cut, then, are dignified as artistic gestures like the brush of bristles across a canvas that, on their own or in series, all serve to create. The canvas wears what strokes cover its once unblemished flesh like contusions. Because the painted canvas itself becomes a wound. And in this same way, through this subtraction of flesh and this spilling of substance, <em>Cicatrization</em> produces, creates, and brings to life, over and again, this real death.</blockquote>

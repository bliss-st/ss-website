<h1>Stratis the Sailor Describes a Man</h1>
<h2>by George Seferis</h2>

1.<br>
But what's the matter with this man?<br>
All through the afternoon (yesterday, the day before yesterday and today) he has been sitting with his eyes fixed upon a flame. <br>
In the evening he bumped into me on his way downstairs.<br>
He said: <br>
"The body dies, water turns cloudy, the soul<br>
Hesitates<br>
And the wind forgets, the wind is always forgetting,<br>
But the flame does not change."<br>
He also said to me:<br>
"You know I love a woman who has gone away, possibly to the world below. But that is not why I look so deserted.<br>
I am trying to hold myself in from a flame,<br>
Because it does not change."<br>
Then he told me the story of his life.

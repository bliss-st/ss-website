<h1>Stratis the Sailor Describes a Man</h1>
<h2>by George Seferis</h2>

1.<br>
But what's the matter with this man?<br>
All through the afternoon (yesterday, the day before yesterday and today) he has been sitting with his eyes fixed upon a flame. <br>
In the evening he bumped into me on his way downstairs.<br>
He said: <br>
"The body dies, water turns cloudy, the soul<br>
Hesitates<br>
And the wind forgets, the wind is always forgetting,<br>
But the flame does not change."<br>
He also said to me:<br>
"You know I love a woman who has gone away, possibly to the world below. But that is not why I look so deserted.<br>
I am trying to hold myself in from a flame,<br>
Because it does not change."<br>
Then he told me the story of his life.<br>
<br>
2. <em>Child</em><br>
When I started to grow up, I was tortured by the trees.<br>
Why do you smile? Were you thinking of spring, which is cruel to children?<br>
I was very fond of the green leaves;<br>
I think I learnt a few things at school because the blotting paper on my desk was green too.<br>
It was the roots of the trees that tortured me, when in the winter warmth they came to twine about my body.<br>
These were the only dreams I had in childhood.<br>
In this way I became acquainted with my body.<br>

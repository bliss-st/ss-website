<h1>Stratis the Sailor Describes a Man</h1>
<h2>by George Seferis</h2>

1.
But what's the matter with this man?
All through the afternoon (yesterday, the day before yesterday and today) he has been sitting with his eyes fixed upon a flame. 
In the evening he bumped into me on his way downstairs.
He said: 
"The body dies, water turns cloudy, the soul
Hesitates
And the wind forgets, the wind is always forgetting,
But the flame does not change."
He also said to me:
"You know I love a woman who has gone away, possibly to the world below. But that is not why I look so deserted.
I am trying to hold myself in from a flame,
Because it does not change."
Then he told me the story of his life.

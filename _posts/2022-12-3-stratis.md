<h1>Stratis the Sailor Describes a Man</h1>
<h2>by George Seferis (tr. Rex Warner)</h2>

<p>1.<br><p>
But what's the matter with this man?<br>
All through the afternoon (yesterday, the day before yesterday and today) he has been sitting with his eyes fixed upon a flame. <br>
In the evening he bumped into me on his way downstairs.<br>
He said: <br>
'The body dies, water turns cloudy, the soul<br>
Hesitates<br>
And the wind forgets, the wind is always forgetting,<br>
But the flame does not change.'<br>
He also said to me:<br>
'You know I love a woman who has gone away, possibly to the world below. But that is not why I look so deserted.<br>
I am trying to hold myself in from a flame,<br>
Because it does not change.'<br>
Then he told me the story of his life.<br>
<br>
<p>2. <em>Child</em><br><p>
When I started to grow up, I was tortured by the trees.<br>
Why do you smile? Were you thinking of spring, which is cruel to children?<br>
I was very fond of the green leaves;<br>
I think I learnt a few things at school because the blotting paper on my desk was green too.<br>
It was the roots of the trees that tortured me, when in the winter warmth they came to twine about my body.<br>
These were the only dreams I had in childhood.<br>
In this way I became acquainted with my body.<br>
<br>
<p>3. <em>Adolescent</em><br><p>
In the summer of my sixteenth year a strange voice sang in my ears. <br>
I was standing, I remember, by the sea's edge, among the red nets and the shell of an abandoned boat like a skeleton. <br>
I tried to get nearer to that voice by putting my ear down on the sand.<br>
The voice vanished<br>
But a shooting star<br>
As though I had never seen a shooting star before,<br>
And on my lips the salt taste of the waves.<br>
That night the roots of the trees no longer came.<br>
Next day a voyage unfolded in my mind, then shut again like a picture book.<br>
I thought of going down every evening to the shore<br>
To learn first about the shore and then to take to the sea. <br>
On the third day I fell in love with a girl on a hill; <br>
She had a little white house like a mountain chapel; <br>
An old mother by the window, spectacles bent over the knitting<br>
Never a word,<br>
A pot of basil, a pot of carnations.<br>
She was called, I think, Vasso, Frosso, or Bilio;<br>
So I forgot the sea. <br>
One Monday in October<br>
I found a broken jar in front of the little white house.<br>
Vasso (let us say for short) appeared in a black dress,<br>
Her hair disordered, her eyes red.<br>
To my question she replied:<br>
'She is dead; the doctor says she died because we didn't slaughter the black cock on the foundations... How could we get hold of a black cock here?... There is nothing except white flocks... and the poultry in the market are sold already plucked.'<br>
This was not how I had imagined grief and death.<br>
I left and went back to the sea.<br>
That night on the deck of the <em>St. Nicholas</em><br>
I dreamed of a very old olive tree in tears.<br>
<br>
<p>4. <em>Young man</em><br><p>
I sailed for one year with Captain Odysseus.<br>
I felt fine.<br>
In fair weather I would settle down in the prow next to the siren figure-head; <br>
I sang of her red lips while I stared at the flying-fish.<br>
When it was rough I huddled up in a corner of the hold with the ship's dog to keep me warm.<br>
At the end of the year one morning I saw minarets. <br>
The ship's mate said: <br>
'That is Saint Sophia. Tonight I'll take you to find some girls.'<br>
So I came to know those women who wear only stockings,<br>
The ones we choose, yes, those ones.<br>
It was a funny sort of place,<br>
A garden with two walnut-trees, a vine-trellis, a well<br>
And a wall all around with broken glass on the top.<br>
A ditch was singing 'On the stream of my life.'<br>
Then I saw for the first time a heart<br>
Pierced by the famous arrow.<br>
It was drawn on the wall with a piece of charcoal. <br>
I saw the leaves of the vine<br>
Fallen to the earth, all yellow,<br>
Plastered to the paving stones in the wretched mud,<br>
And I made a step to go back again to the ship.<br>
Then the mate took me by the collar and threw me into the well;<br>
Warm water, and so much life all round the skin.<br>
Afterwards the girl told me, while she was playing idly with her right breast,<br>
'I come from Rhodes. They betrothed me at thirteen for a hundred paras.'<br>
And the ditch was singing 'On the stream of my life...'<br>
I remembered the broken jar in the cool afternoon and I thought<br>
'She too will die. How will she die?'<br>
But all I said to her was<br>
'Look out, or you will spoil it. It's your livelihood.'<br>
That night on the ship I did not dare go near the siren;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was ashamed of her.<br>

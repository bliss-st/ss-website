<em>Undone</em>

the sky burns<br>
with the same chemicals<br>
as the ooze in the port<br>
for which you feel neither<br>
responsible nor absolved<br>
but the third feeling which<br>
both the guilty and innocent <br>
call "implicated," and<br>
though you cannot see them<br>
you know that the roof<br>
of the clouds and the floor<br>
of the canal <br>
are lined with cast-off <br>
evidence, like your soul<br>
which at its best<br>
was never clear water<br>
but a neater scrawl<br>

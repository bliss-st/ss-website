I like Justin Murphy's Other Life newsletter, and I wanted to briefly respond to [this post]("https://www.otherlife.co/pkm/"). In it he writes that "Personal Knowledge Management" softwares and the "Knowledge Graph ideology" that goes with them is mostly marketing and that no software tool will ever make you smart, though they can make you <em>seem</em> smart. He writes that "the sex appeal of the Knowledge Graph derives from the fantasy of not having to decide what's most important." Frankly I have no idea where he got this. 

To me the point of a Roam graph is not to lose anything that I have already decided is important. For example, it is important to me to learn new words when I read and use them in my own writing. If I were smarter I would be able to look up every new word that I encounter while reading, memorize it on the spot, and have it for posterity. Unfortunately I have to use a word in a sentence a couple of times before I truly own it. If I were more conscientious, I might remember to send birthday cards a week ahead time. If I were juggling fewer gigs, I might be able to keep deadlines straight. If I had paid more attention in high school, I might already know the basic outline of American history. Having a knowledge graph helps me compensate for failures like these dozens of times throughout the day.

I agree with Murphy that a knowledge graph will not make a great thinker out of a lesser one. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that the most important thing about writing is "imposing order, hierarchy, and linearity," the nonhierarchical systems like Roam, etc. do create an opportunity for the totalists to attempt to totalize (to grow fat on digital data, in Murphy's words). I am reminded of the kids in high school who would highlight huge paragraphs instead of taking specific notes, but if I recall correctly, those kids usually did pretty well. They might not have been the boldest or the brightest, but they were indubitably studious and enthusiastic.

To me the most important aspect of thinking and writing well is simply doing it every day. The great writers/thinkers/artists who didn't do this are as exceptional as Luhmann. Softwares like Roam depend on daily usage; the true hierarchy of Roam is each day's Daily Notes Page, the Roam homepage, and then other pages which can be easily created, but are not immediately available.

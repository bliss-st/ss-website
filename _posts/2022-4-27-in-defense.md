I like Justin Murphy's Other Life newsletter, and I wanted to briefly respond to [this post]("https://www.otherlife.co/pkm/"). In it he writes that "Personal Knowledge Management" software and the "Knowledge Graph ideology" that goes with it is mostly marketing and that no software tool will ever make you smart, though they can make you <em>seem</em> smart. He argues that "the point of writing—and what the greatest authors have always done—is to cut through the knowledge graph with a bold and forceful line." 

Clearly he is correct that personal knowledge management systems like Roam Research do not make great thinkers from lesser ones. He is also correct that these systems are prone to bloat, or what he calls "digital obesity."

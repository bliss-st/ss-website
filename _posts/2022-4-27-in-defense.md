I like Justin Murphy's Other Life newsletter, and I wanted to briefly respond to [this post]("https://www.otherlife.co/pkm/"). In it he writes that "Personal Knowledge Management" software and the "Knowledge Graph ideology" that goes with it is mostly marketing and that no software tool will ever make you smart, though they can make you <em>seem</em> smart.

Clearly he is correct that personal knowledge management systems like Roam Research do not make great thinkers from lesser ones. He is also correct that these systems are prone to bloat, or what he calls "digital obesity." I would imagine that anyone who has tried to keep a planner, never mind a Roam graph, is familiar with the totalizing urge and subsequent abandonment of organizational systems. I don't think this makes planners useless. Murphy writes that "the sex appeal of the Knowledge Graph derives from the fantasy of not having to decide what's most important." Frankly I have no idea where he got this idea. 

To me the point of a Roam graph is not to lose anything that I have already decided is important. Perhaps if I were smarter I would be able to look up every new word that I encounter while reading, memorize it on the spot, and have it for posterity. But this action would interrupt my reading. If I were more conscientious, I might remember to send birthday cards a week ahead time. If I were juggling fewer gigs, I might be able to keep deadlines straight. If I had paid more attention in high school, I might already know the basic outline of American history. The knowledge graph helps me compensate for these failures

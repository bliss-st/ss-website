I like Justin Murphy's Other Life newsletter, and I wanted to briefly respond to [this post]("https://www.otherlife.co/pkm/"). In it he writes that "Personal Knowledge Management" softwares and the "Knowledge Graph ideology" that goes with them is mostly marketing and that no software tool will ever make you smart, though they can make you <em>seem</em> smart. He writes that "the sex appeal of the Knowledge Graph derives from the fantasy of not having to decide what's most important." Frankly I have no idea where he got this. 

To me the point of a Roam graph is not to lose anything that I have already decided is important. For example, it is important to me to learn new words when I read and use them in my own writing. If I were smarter I would be able to look up every new word that I encounter while reading, memorize it on the spot, and have it for posterity. But this action would interrupt my reading. If I were more conscientious, I might remember to send birthday cards a week ahead time. If I were juggling fewer gigs, I might be able to keep deadlines straight. If I had paid more attention in high school, I might already know the basic outline of American history. Having a knowledge graph helps me compensate for failures like these dozens of times throughout the day.

I agree with Murphy that a knowledge graph will not make a great thinker out of a lesser one. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that the most important thing about writing is "imposing order, hierarchy, and linearity," the nonhierarchical aspects of Roam Research and systems like it do create an opportunity for the totalists to attempt to totalize (to grow fat on digital data, in Murphy's words).

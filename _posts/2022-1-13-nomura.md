I am the threshold<br>
<br>
Without dimension<br>
Without comfort<br>
Here is my other self<br>
Made to stand on its toes<br>
<br>
While writing the character for 'grave' (墓)<br>
I detect the smell of 'India ink' (墨)<br>
Or it seems that way, I'm sure of it<br>
My other self<br>
The one who dances<br>
<br>
Between stalks of white horseweed<br>
How far ... how far<br>
Stretching all the way to the end of summer<br>
The train tracks rusted red<br>
<br>
Look<br>
One threshold overlaps another<br>
When held, there are any number of places you can rest<br>
O dancing one<br>
Fragments of sparkling faces fall<br>
All along the furrow of your spine<br>
<br>
Like a benediction<br>
<br>
And when it falls on me<br>
O dancing one<br>
You have already departed silently from the threshold<br>
And again from somewhere<br>
The smell of India ink<br>
<br>
The threshold<br>
Diligently mixes the murmur of voices with hushed silence<br>
<br>
It's only me<br>
The threshold ...<br>
<br>
<br>

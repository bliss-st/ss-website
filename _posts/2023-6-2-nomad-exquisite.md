As the immense dew of Florida<br>
Brings forth<br>
The big-finned palm<br>
And green vine angering for life,<br>
<br>
As the immense dew of Florida<br>
Brings forth hymn and hymn <br>
From the beholder,<br>
Beholding all these green sides<br>
And gold sides of green sides,<br>
<br>
And blessed mornings,<br>
Meet for the eye of the young alligator,<br>
And lightning colors<br>
So, in me, come flinging<br>
Forms, flames, and the flakes of flames.

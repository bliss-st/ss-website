She finally had some time alone and then... the zone,<br>
The tunnel, the long simmer had been passed through.<br>
She went to return the things that had been left with her. <br>
Warm hands from the television reached out,<br>
Caressed, and everyone knew the joke. <br>
Forbidden plastic filled up the ice chest. <br>
Cygnets in the bay comingled with roses.<br>
Wild headlights. As if nothing had taken<br>
Place, or hold, even the scars she'd sworn<br>
She'd recognize in any lineup, gone.<br>
It was not freeing; it was the hallway<br>
Between schoolrooms, the almost-autumn<br>
Sense of not belonging to a world so<br>
Regular it could be regularly paused.<br>
In the moments between crises A and B<br>
She took the book, the scarf, the clear container<br>
Home to their owners, some of whom,<br>
In the interim, had grown immeasurably old.<br>
Who spoke sadly, who mourned<br>
The loss of childhoods not their own.<br>
Suddenly everyone had a plot of land.<br>
In one, one had hung death's blue light<br>
And claimed to have seen a garden snake.<br>
She believed it; she believed in the reappearance<br>
Of all thought-defeated things, even here, between<br>
The underpass and the windshield repair store.

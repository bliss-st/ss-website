I wish all websites were like <a href="https://www.apocalypse-survival.com/">this</a>. I especially enjoyed the post "<a href="https://www.apocalypse-survival.com/how-to-build-a-casket.html">How to Build a Casket</a>." Like many preppers, this blogger is a bit self-serious. But the information is conveyed so clearly and appealingly...

They race towards the line I stand on.<br>
Then they are arguing around me<br>
<br>
and laughing too. They hoop, <br>
they enact a living, they say <br>
<br>
the season ends too soon. <br>
Like the winter beyond the Aprils <br>
<br>
the paint at the court lines <br>
gaps in the overlight.<br>
<br>
All extinguished in a moment.

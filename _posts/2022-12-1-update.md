Would it surprise you to know she claims to be a woman?<br>
Born with the managerial talent. Born speaking tooth-knocking<br>
Valiantly clear cardinals and coordinates. In the precise house<br>
Of her choosing, set back a ways from the country road.<br>
Jade square in the corn. Drawn field in the musket.<br>
Her cradle the iron memorial for Vietnam anonymous<br>
Clasped disembodied hands of huge proportions. <br>
In truth she never moved among them, too quickly<br>
Recognized by children. When the suits came to ask,<br>
To verify her fitness, no one spoke besides a drunk.<br>
<em>I know that child. I saw her… I was twenty years ago<br>
Fishing found her on the shore</em>, not one in the borough,<br>
<em>Sleeping infinitely peacefully though she was lost, forgotten<br>
(We’ve all done it) at the gas station.</em> Late morning split<br>
She woke a free beast to prowl the national latticework.

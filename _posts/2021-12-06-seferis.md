<p><h4>4</h4></p>
<p><em>Argonauts</em>
	<p>And if the soul<br>
		is to know itself<br>
		it must look<br>
		into a soul:<br>
		the stranger and enemy, we've seen him in the mirror.<br>
<br>
		The companions were good men, they never complained<br>
		about the work or the thirst or the frost,<br>
		they had the bearing of trees and waves<br>
		that accept the wind and the rain<br>
		accept the night and the sun <br>
		without changing in the midst of change. <br>
		They were good men, whole days <br>
		they sweated at the oars with lowered eyes<br>
		breathing in rhythm<br>
		and their blood reddened a submissive skin.<br>
		Sometimes they sang, with lowered eyes<br>
		as we were passing the dry island with the Barbary figs<br>
		to the west, beyond the cape<br>
		of the barking dogs.<br>
		If it is to know itself, they said<br>
		it must look into a soul, they said<br>
		and the oars struck the sea's gold<br>
		in the sunset.<br>
		We passed many capes many islands the sea<br>
		leading to another sea, gulls and seals. <br>
		Sometimes unfortunate women wept<br>
		lamenting their lost children<br>
		and others raging sought Alexander the Great<br>
		and glories buried in the depths of Asia. <br>
		We moored on shores full of night-scents<br>
		with the singing of birds, waters that left on the hands<br>
		the memory of great happiness.<br>
		But the voyages did not end.<br>
		Their souls became one with the oars and the oarlocks<br>
		with the solemn face of the prow<br>
		with the rudder's wake<br>
		with the water that shattered their image.<br>
		The companions died in turn, <br>
		with lowered eyes. Their oars<br>
		mark the place where they sleep on the shore.<br>
<br>
		No one remembers them. Justice.</p>

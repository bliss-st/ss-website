It occurred in two phases:<br>
quiet years of the life aquatic<br>
then flight, for just a few hours,<br>
before I died on the foamy shelf.<br>
To the dark water I reluctantly<br>
return, over the worn stones<br>
home where I am called, like<br>
all my kind, back into sand,<br>
the substance of our history.<br>
Some of the dead are winged.<br>
Some are not. I do not care,<br>
I do not remember. The past's<br>
weight crushes my carapace.<br>
I did not know love, only<br>
blindness. I ate animals<br>
much larger than myself,<br>
moved in the shadows,<br>
attacked a human child.<br>
There was no redemption<br>
but job security: visitors<br>
wandering in from the light,<br>
whose voices rang and stung,<br>
never forgot the sight of us.<br>
We grew huge in the riverbed.

I've started eating Dunkin Donuts almost every day before work. Today I had a French vanilla ice coffee and an old-fashioned donut, which I think is a quality order. The poem I was writing with the weather prediction in it didn't work out but I still think fall will be chilly this year. âœ„

This is the view from my office at sunset:

Sunset is still impressive a month in. C@&*3 N!%+ can barely afford to stay in the building, I'm guessing, but it's worth it for the views. When I look up from my computer the city looks like a tapestry, these days flat, powdery, and blue. I seriously answered blue when someone asked me what my favorite color was this week.

Currently I'm listening to _Fatal Vision_ on Audible

because my mom gave me a yearlong subscription for my birthday (thanks Mom!). It's been a  taxing read so far. Before this I never understood how a murder could be boring exactly the way jury duty is boring. That said, the crime the book is about is unbelievably violent, and so coolly and factually described. Banal + violent _is_ kind of up my alley, ergo why I'm thirty-six hours deep in the book, but it's hard to tell what the point of the book is besides information, at least so far. Maybe the author will insert himself at the end. I'm looking forward to reading Janet Malcolm's [essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journalist_and_the_Murderer) about the writing of _Fatal Vision_, though. Because at the end of the day I just gotta know.

I've been awake past four every single night for about two weeks. It's been great, actually. The bummer is that I haven't found a way to be reliably alive between 8 and 11 am, which used to be my favorite time of the day. I'll take tips from anyone who works a night shift. This girl in my office works our almost full-time job _and_ at a restaurant _and_ doesn't drink coffee. I have no idea how she does it, but I can tell that being awake in the morning is the key. 

Is it just the blue light keeping me up?

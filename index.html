		<p>Every so often I'll be sitting at my computer, usually in bed, putzing around, watching television or writing or what have you, and I'll think to myself, reading is so fucking good, it opens the whole world to me, but the internet? I can <em>feel</em> it. It's so close I can almost taste it. I reach out through these keys and there it is: so many more sounds and images and consciousnesses than I can store in my brain that my brain can't even process how much there is. A cosmos! And the tools to make so many more things!
			<p>Sure it's a romantic vision. Allow me. One has to make (and take!) opportunities to be romantic about things, otherwise you're Milo at the beginning of <em>The Phanthom Tolbooth</em>, always looking down at your shoes.
				<p>For example, watching a blizzard from a window is romantic, especially at night. Knowing in your bones that it's cold, and feeling all the plant life dying, admiring the snow as it comes down, making predictions about the snowfall's depth and the condition of the roads, the sky that obscure maroonish color... Knowing the coming morning will dazzle... These are romantic feelings and it's good to have them.</p>
				<p>At least, I've been sincerely enjoying having them. </p>
					<p>The internet and the weather. Is it a shame that nothing else is real? I had a brief flirtation with geological time, earth's slowest, but like the bovine skull that's moved with my sister from apartment to apartment, eventually everything turns to sediment and comes off in your hands. The organic and inorganic become flexible on the molecular level. </p>
						<p>Due to the skull's preservation, I assume, only the top layer crumbles, not enough to damage the piece, which is still tremendously hard and heavy, and at least thirty years old. Our uncle is said to have acquired it during dental school. â™¦</p>

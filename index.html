				<h3>Nosebleed</h3>
				<p>And there was a space in the copse<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;we did not call a clearing<br>
					And we know that when Dad sells the house<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;we will not return here<br>
					And a drop of acid on a flame<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;creates a brilliant flash of color<br>
					And a poem in the new book is blue<br>
					And at work the cyan cartridge leaks<br>
					And when I first learned to drive I bled<br>
					And quickly cooled and turned obsidian<br>

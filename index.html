				<h2>Parataxis / Epistaxis</h2>
				<p id="comment"><em>...a maddening title, but to my mind the simplest and most accurate... the first word refers to a technique in poetry in which images or fragments, usually starkly dissimilar, are juxtaposed without a clear connection, while the second word simply means "nosebleed"</em></p>
				<p>And there was a space in the copse<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;we did not call a clearing<br>
					And we know that when Dad sells the house<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;we will not return here<br>
					And a poem in the new book is blue<br>
					And at work the cyan cartridge leaks<br>
					And a drop of acid on a flame<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;creates a brilliant flash of color<br>
					And when I first learned to drive I bled<br>
					And quickly cooled and turned obsidian<br>

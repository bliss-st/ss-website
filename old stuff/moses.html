		<h1>This is What Brothers Do </h1>
		<p>In my varsity dream I’m captain<br>
			and you’re the one kissing my cleats.<br>
			<br>
			I look over the ledge of a stiff hill<br>
			from the San Bernardino Mission and,<br>
			rotating courtside, you push two season tickets<br>
			to the best show in town to my chest—<br>
			Our bows grow fast & strong here, where the hurricane hits<br>
			hard and in circles around my body.<br>
			<br>
			My belly aches and I know you can’t make it better—<br>
			I’m focused on the game,<br>
			hands leave the trap,<br>
			throw the pig through my legs,<br>
			palms clammed up with an excitement<br>
			or a frost that makes them close tight with fear—<br>
			I can’t quite feel the tips of my fingers but<br>
			it’s midsummer and ninety-some-odd degrees<br>
			in the shade.<br>
			<br>
			You tell me your dad’s a good time pharaoh but that<br>
			he and your mom are two doors next to each other<br>
			that open to different rooms.<br>
			You dribble a little and say,<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Remember when we were in high school<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we used to laugh & kiss at the same time?</em><br>
			Growing the greenbelt feels impossible<br>
			but the summer just started and before you know it<br>
			we’ll both jump the fence into our own private mysteries.<br>
			<br>
			Cupid draws his bow and shoots a thick arrow into the shadows,<br>
			far back in the darkest part of the park.<br>
			It’s Ten Pee Em and so hot I can feel a little dew in my brow—<br>
			There’s a lot of heat here for us<br>
			on the edge of the basketball court. <br>
			<br>
			Tomorrow I’ll have a lap around the middle school,<br>
			take off my shirt while I’m still running<br>
			and tie it around my neck—<br>
			I don’t feel how hot the sun is<br>
			until it’s not there anymore.<br>
			<br>
			There are so many things I have to do but<br>
			I am waiting for you to get here.<br>
			You are far away right now but<br>
			I can hold you if I want—<br>
			I can taste you if I open my mouth wide<br>
		enough.<br></p></div>

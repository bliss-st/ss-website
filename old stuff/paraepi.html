				<h2>Parataxis / Epistaxis</h2>
				<p id="comment"><em>... a maddening title, but to my mind the simplest and most accurate... the first word refers to a technique in poetry in which images or fragments, usually starkly dissimilar, are juxtaposed without a clear connection, while the second word simply means "nosebleed"</em></p>
				<p>
					There was a place in the copse<br>
					We did not call a clearing<br>
					And when Dad sells the house we know<br>
					We will not return here<br>
					<br>
					And a poem in the new book is blue<br>
					And at work the cyan cartridge leaks<br>
					And a drop of acid on a flame<br>
					Creates a brilliant spike of color<br>
					<br>
					And driving out of town I bled<br>
					And quickly cooled and turned obsidian<br>

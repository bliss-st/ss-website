<p>back in the day of museums<br />
if you remember<br />
there was one north of the city<br />
where a room had been styled to resemble<br />
the simple quarters of the early Christians</p>

<p>on the wall of that room<br />
a painting of precisely that room<br />
but in that image, annunciation</p>

<p>tell me an angel<br />
isnâ€™t a trick of the eye</p>

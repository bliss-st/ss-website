<blockquote>
  <p>When I first saw snow cover the air<br />
with its delicate hoofprints, I said I would never<br />
live where it did not snow, and when<br />
the first man tore his way into me,<br />
and tore up the passageway,<br />
and came to the small room, and pulled the<br />
curtain aside that I might enter, I knew I could <br />
never live apart from them<br />
again, the strange race with their massive<br />
bloodied hooves. Today we lay in our<br />
small bedroom, dark gold with<br />
reflected snow, and while the flakes climbed<br />
delicately down the sky, you<br />
came into me, pressing aside<br />
the curtain, revealing the small room,<br />
dark gold with reflected snow,<br />
where we lay, and where you entered me and<br />
pressed the curtain aside, revealing<br />
the small room, dark gold with<br />
reflected snow, where we lay.</p>

<p>I’ve read this poem each winter for the past 3 winters. At first I thought it was hot, then I thought it was frightening. In any case, it definitely doesn’t snow here in New York as much as it used to. Last year it got cold but there was just one day of snow. A dusting of less than an inch that melted before sundown. This year people are predicting blizzards again but with no real confidence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through centuries he lived in poverty.<br />
God only was his only elegance.</p>

  <p>Then generation by generation he grew<br />
Stronger and freer, a little better off.</p>

  <p>He lived each life because, if it was bad,<br />
He said a good life would be possible.</p>

  <p>At last the good life came, good sleep, bright fruit,<br />
And Lazarus betrayed him to the rest,</p>

  <p>Who killed him, sticking feathers in his flesh<br />
To mock him. They placed with him in his grave</p>

  <p>Sour wine to warn him, an empty book to read;<br />
And over it they set a jagged sign,</p>

  <p>Epitaphium to his death, which read,<br />
The Good Man Has No Shape, as if they knew.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I canâ€™t make head or tails of this poem.</p>

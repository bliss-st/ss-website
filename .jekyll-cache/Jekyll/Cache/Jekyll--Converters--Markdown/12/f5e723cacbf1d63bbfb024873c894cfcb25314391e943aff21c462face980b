I"Y<p>Finally I just gave up and became my father,<br />
his greased, defeated face shining toward<br />
anyone I looked at, his mud-brown eyes<br />
in my face, glistening like wet ground that<br />
things you love have fallen onto<br />
and been lost for good. I stopped trying<br />
not to have his bad breath,<br />
his slumped posture of failure, his sad<br />
sex dangling on his thigh, his stomach<br />
swollen and empty. I gave inÂ <br />
to my true self, I faced the world<br />
through his sour mash, his stained acrid<br />
vision, I floated out on his tears.<br />
I saw the whole world shining<br />
with the ecstasy of his grief, and I<br />
myself, he, I, shined,<br />
my oiled porous cheeks glaucous<br />
as tulips, the rich smear of the petal,<br />
the bulb hidden in the dark soil,<br />
stuck, impacted, sure of its rightful place.</p>

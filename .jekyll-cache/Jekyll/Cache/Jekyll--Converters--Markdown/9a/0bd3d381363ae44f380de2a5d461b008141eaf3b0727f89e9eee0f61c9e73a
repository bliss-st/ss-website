I"O<p>Monster sleep,<br />
what runs in your trenches, your thought<br />
estuarial, briny or brackish but never fresh.<br />
The tides have passed a law<br />
for the conservation of salt, and since there’s salt<br />
in blood there’s salt in every wound.<br />
The little crystals bite. The thinking hurts.<br />
Dear monster I</p>

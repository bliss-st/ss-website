I"B	<p>Do whatever it takes to rest. When sorrow<br />
sits on your chest, give him a lick. I have no clue<br />
if I’m old or young. I think you’re a young lady<br />
who should know I’ve never been to a castle,<br />
though I did spend a day at the Climatron and,<br />
after, scooped lotus pods from the mud. They<br />
didn’t dry well. I wish you well. It’s possible<br />
for a year to forget where it left itself. Don’t<br />
worry. The trees immolate. My waking dreams<br />
involve shoeing horses, pounding silver sheet<br />
into a lake. “A match burning in a crocus”: I’d feed<br />
children to wolves to be so precise. <!-- more -->My house<br />
blinks all night with small lights. I know you know<br />
what I mean. I love incandescence the way<br />
some women love God. Where you are, is it<br />
gone? Do all the lights hum in sad tubes? I seam<br />
the hour to the hour, flee parties like a woman<br />
might flee killer bees. Go to sleep. Was a girlhood,<br />
some hitchhiking, a man like a Viking stirring<br />
polenta on an island in another century several<br />
cataclysms ago: blink of an eye. Take the State<br />
for a patron, but not for a wife. If sometimes<br />
I seem not here, it’s not dreaminess; it’s fear. <br />
If sometimes I don’t hear, it’s not celestial<br />
ringing, but this inner ear thing I’ve had since<br />
I lived in the city. At Babel, all the workers<br />
knew the Milky Way spread like fat between meat<br />
but felt zero need to say so. Look at something<br />
till your eyes burn. Pitcher plants drown<br />
their prey: not euphemism. The kettle’s burning. <br />
A woman felt called by don’t-know-what<br />
scratching like plumeria inside her. Abide, abide<br />
says alluvial time. Trickster, long con, light<br />
throws its nets over the yard. These words reek<br />
of eucalyptus, bathtub gin. When the sky<br />
turns absinthe, take cover. Say you’re watching<br />
the play where the woman turns into a tree and<br />
suddenly, first act: tornado sirens. Her soul is sap.<br />
Water pools on the floor. Ask yourself: do I love<br />
the woman I’m sitting with? Don’t get gyred into sky.<br />
It’s lonely there. Listen: the book is always burning.<br />
So’s the city. The water on stage is prop water,<br />
can’t put out anything. Blink if you can hear me.</p>

I"<p>Monster sleep,<br />
what runs in your trenches, your thought<br />
estuarial, briny or brackish but never fresh.<br />
The tides have passed a law<br />
for the conservation of salt, and since there’s salt<br />
in blood there’s salt in every wound.<br />
The little crystals bite. The thinking hurts.<br />
Dear monster I</p>

<p>feel for you, would it were otherwise. Here where<br />
river and ocean contend <br />
that river be river and ocean, ocean,<br />
both are mistaken.<br />
Where flow makes churn<br />
and long waves ravel<br />
and the stray coelacanth pops up, says <em>Uncle</em><br />
or <em>Pass Not</em> or <em>Wake Now for monster</em></p>

<p><em>must be alone</em>, I wake, obedient<br />
weary. I dreamed you<br />
had something to tell me.</p>

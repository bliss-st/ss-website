<p>The Got whome we serve is able to deliver<br />
Us. Good chemistry, good common man, what<br />
Of that angelic sword? Creature ofÂ <br />
Ten times ten times dynamite, convulsive<br />
Angel, convulsive shatterer, gun,<br />
Click, click, the Got whom we serve is able,<br />
Still, still to deliver us, still magic,<br />
Still moving yet motionless in smoke, still<br />
One with us, in the heaved-up noise, stillÂ <br />
Captain, the man of skill, the expert<br />
Leader, the creator of bursting color<br />
And rainbow sortilege, the savage weaponÂ <br />
Against enemies, against the prester,<br />
Presto, whose whispers prickle the spirit.</p>

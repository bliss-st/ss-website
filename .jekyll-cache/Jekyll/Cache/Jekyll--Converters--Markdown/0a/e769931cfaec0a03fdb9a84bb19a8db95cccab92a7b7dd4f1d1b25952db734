I"È<p>the feelings I get<br />
driving past the railroad yard<br />
(never on purpose but on my way to somewhere)<br />
are the feelings other men have for other things.<br />
I see the tracks and all the boxcars<br />
the tank cars the flat cars<br />
all of them motionless and so many of them<br />
perfectly lined up and not an engine anywhere<br />
(where are all the engines?).<br />
I drive past looking sideways at it all<br />
a wide, still railroad yard<br />
not a human in sight<br />
then I am past the yard<br />
and it wasnâ€™t just the romance of it all<br />
that gives me what I get<br />
but something back there nameless<br />
always making me feel better<br />
as some men feel better looking at the open sea<br />
or the mountains or at wild animals<br />
or at a woman<br />
I like those things too<br />
especially the wild animals and the woman<br />
but when I see those lovely old boxcars<br />
with their faded painted lettering<br />
and those flat cars and those fat round tankers<br />
all lined up and waiting<br />
I get quiet inside<br />
I get what other men get from other things<br />
I just feel better and itâ€™s good to feel better<br />
whenever you can<br />
not needing a reason.</p>

<p>Likely as not a ruined head gasket<br />
Spitting at every power stroke, if not a crank shaft<br />
Bearing knocking at the roots of the thing like a pile-driver:<br />
A machine involved with itself, a concentrated<br />
Hot lump of a machine<br />
Geared in the loose mechanics of the world with the valves jumping<br />
And the heavy frenzy of the pistons. When the thing stops,<br />
Is stopped, with the last slow coughÂ <br />
In the manifold, the flywheel blundering<br />
Against compression, stopping, finally<br />
Stopped, compression leaking<br />
From the idle cylinders will one imagine<br />
Then because he can imagine<br />
That squeezed from the cooling steel<br />
There hovers in that moment, wraith-like and like a plume of steam, an aftermath,<br />
A still and quiet angel of knowledge and of comprehension.</p>

<p>Endlessly, endlessly<br />
The definition of mortality</p>

<p>The image of the engine<br />
That stops.<br />
We cannot live on that.<br />
I know that no one would live out<br />
Thirty years, fifty years if the world were ending<br />
With his life.<br />
The machine stares out,<br />
Stares out<br />
With all its eyes</p>

<p>Thru the glass<br />
With the ripple in it, past the sill<br />
Which is dustyâ€”If there is someone<br />
In the garden!<br />
Outside, and so beautiful.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>What ends<br />
Is that.<br />
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Even companionship<br />
Ending.</p>

<p>â€˜I want to ask if you remember<br />
When we were happy! As tho all travels</p>

<p>Ended untold, all embarkationsÂ <br />
Foundered.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>On that water<br />
Grey with morning<br />
The gull will fold its wings<br />
And sit. And with its two eyes<br />
There as much as anything<br />
Can watch a ship and all its hallways<br />
And all companions sink.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p><em>Also he has set the world<br />
In their hearts</em> . From lumps, chunks,</p>

<p>We are locked out: like children, seeking love<br />
At last among each other. With their first full strength<br />
The young go search for it,</p>

<p>But even the beautiful bony children<br />
Who arise in the morning have left behind<br />
Them worn and squalid toys in the trash</p>

<p>Which is a grimy death of love. The lost<br />
Glitter of the stores!<br />
The streets of stores!<br />
Crossed by the streets of stores<br />
And every crevice of the city leaking<br />
Rubble: concrete, conduit, pipe, a crumbling<br />
Rubble of our roots</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â But they will find<br />
In flood, storm, ultimate mishap:<br />
Earth, water, the tremendous<br />
Surface, the heart thundering<br />
Absolute desire.</p>

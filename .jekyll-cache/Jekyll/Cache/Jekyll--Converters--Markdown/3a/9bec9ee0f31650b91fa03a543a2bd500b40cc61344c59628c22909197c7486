I"B<p>I have come inside to tell you<br />
the world floats around us,<br />
insolent weeds and grape arbors,<br />
bottles and rust.<br />
Leave me alone to sing,<br />
I will bother no one.<br />
I remember a boy<br />
who danced with a fish.<br />
How can I answer<br />
his mutterings,<br />
that I should remember him<br />
diving there?<br />
He’ll dive forever<br />
unless I forego<br />
memory, song,<br />
my fool’s-truth lever<br />
under the solidly wrong.<br />
I remember a man<br />
who loved me forever,<br />
so briefly.<br />
I remember a woman<br />
who told him yes<br />
I will love you forever.<br />
She is still singing<br />
and he is gone.<br />
This is not his song.<br />
Soon it will happen.<br />
I am getting older<br />
and breathing thinner<br />
air at this altitude.<br />
Thinner and colder.</p>

 <p>I've been thinking it would be good to have a <a href = "https://nownownow.com/about">now</a> page, since I don't post anywhere often anymore. (<a href = "https://twitter.com/polysomnograph/likes">Twitter</a> very occasionally.) Just to say what I'm thinking about, working on, reading etc.</p>
 
 <h4>Writing and Study</h4>
 <p>Since December <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> has become really important to the way I go through my day, from writing to chores to work. So far I've used it to learn the Cyrillic alphabet, mop my house at reasonable intervals, and booze more mindfully. The best use I've found for Roam so far, though, is to learn new vocabulary. I add vocab words either <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/64040bf9f3274f4a8f585b1f742eb736">by hand</a> or by importing them from my Kindle, and then every day I learn a new word and review the definition of an old one, to see if I remember. Screen recording <a href=" https://www.loom.com/share/766a69f8e97f475490c550f3110a5553">here</a>.
 <p>I've written 3 poems this summer after a very dry winter/springtime, all three loosely on the topic of video games, the odd way they dilate reality & time. Here's an excerpt from a poem called "Walkthrough":</p>
 <blockquote>As I am unable to imagine<br>
 That the dragon has shadow<br>
 Powers, or double damage<br>
 Powers, I am prohibited<br>
 From the subtle striking of the<br>
 Left and right buttons<br>
 Which at particular moments<br>
 Seems as much a skill as<br>
 The ratchet or the good knife<br>
 Require, and because I cannot<br>
 See myself as prince of any land<br>
 I become the voice of the guide.</blockquote>
 <p>I've been thinking about the best way to post my poems online but I haven't come up with it yet. </p>
 <h4>Work</h4>
 <p>This summer I have been working on the <a href = "annotations.html"><em>Annotations</em></a> project as well as upcoming issues of <em>Second Factory</em> and <em>Nat. Brut</em>. Everything is due out in the fall, and I'm really excited about all the work I've read. </p>
 <p>For paid-work I've been fact-checking, which I was surprised to find that I like quite a bit. It gives me an excuse to spend short periods of time immersed in subjects I know nothing about, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22598748/terracycle-greenwashing-recycling-lawsuit">the recycling industry</a> or <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a37102070/hannah-roberts-tokyo-olympics/">BMX</a>. </p>
 <h4>Books, Movies, and Television</h4>
 <p>Like many people I know, I found it more difficult to read books this year than usual. I read <em>Savage Detectives</em> in the spring and haven't managed to finish a major novel since. The last book I read cover-to-cover was Elizabeth Strout's <em>Olive, Again</em> which I found poignant but not as gripping as <em>Olive Kitteridge</em>. I've started many books that I'm excited about, like Clark Coolidge's <em>The Crystal Text</em> and Will Alexander's <em>Across the Vapour Gulf</em>, but it is taking me longer than usual to get through them. At the end of the day I think the problem might be that I don't know enough words. Or else, a simple lack of self-discipline.</p>
 <p>I don't read much internet fiction, but I sincerely enjoyed Zero HP Lovecraft's <a href="https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/dont-make-me-think/">"Don't Make Me Think."</a>
 <p>TV-wise, my SO* and I are deep in a rewatch of the <em>Simpsons</em>. I didn't watch it growing up, so it's really a first-time watch for me, but so many of the jokes have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_elVGGgW8">absorbed into the ether</a> I feel like I know them already (I have the same feeling reading Shakespeare). We skipped several seasons of <em>The Walking Dead</em> but jumped back in for season 10, which is just awful. It contains the only boring Russian roulette scene I've ever seen.</p>
 <h4>Wrap Up/Miscellaneous</h4>
 <p>The other week my neighbor's kid left a model solar system out to dry. These days they include Pluto off to the side, subtitled "(Not a planet)." <em>Rick and Morty</em> covered this more thoroughly than I'm planning to, but it's funny to think that Pluto is still so important to our way of thinking about the solar system that it has to be taught. To remember the order of planets, WikiHow recommends the mnemonic "My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine," which lol, or "My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles," which still seems on the verge of politically incorrect. What a mess!</p>
 <p>A website I spend a fair amount of time on these days is <a href="fragrantica.com">Fragrantica</a>. I've always liked perfumes, maybe because my family members didn't wear them and so the adults I knew who did seemed sophisticated and mysterious. The Fragrantica reviewers write the purplest of prose and I really admire their sensual abilities. The phrase "spicy diapy" ruined the sample of L'Artisan Bois Farine that I had, though...</p>
 <p>Anyway, I'm glad to be blogging a little bit again. Thanks for stopping by! X</p>
